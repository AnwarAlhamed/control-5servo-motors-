# control-5servo-motors-
## designing and programing 5 servo motors circuit.
### The circuit design 
The circuit contains:

- aduino UNO.
- 
- Breadboard.
- 
- 5 servo motors.
- 
- Wires ( red= power , black= ground , yellow= signal).
-  
and the circuit was designed using tinkercad website as below:
